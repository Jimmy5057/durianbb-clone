It is a plate with five type of durian (prime, red flash, golden bun, XO and musang king). So it goes from the less sweet to the sweetest, from lower to higher grade. The proce is around MYR 65 if I&#8217;m not mistaken. Unfortunately, black thorn is not included in this platter, you only can putchase one full body of black thorn durian, around 1.5 to 2 kg.<\/p>\n<p>The platter is good choice for me, as i can taste differetn type of durian. And from those five durians, i found out that i dont like Musang King \ud83d\ude02. It is sweet and creamy, but also bitter for me. I prefer the golden bu, a lot less bitter.<\/p>\n<p>The durian a bit pricy compared to other stores, but the platter is a good option to get exposure to different type of durias. And the people there are very friendly.&#8221;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;I was in Kuala Lumpur and would like to try the famous Musang King, found this place having good review in google maps.
