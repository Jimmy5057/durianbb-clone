Durian365@Corus features dining of selected durian fruit in a specially-segregated and enclosed dining room all year round, believed to be the first-ever in hotels here, as well as promoting a range of uniquely-created durian desserts.<\/p>\n<p>Yang Berhormat Tuan Muhammad Bakhtiar Bin Wan Chik said: \u201cThis is an exemplary private sector-led initiative, which not only promotes the premium varieties of durian from Malaysia\u2019s very own plantations, it also supports the Government\u2019s plans to go big on durian tourism.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;I urge more from the private sector, such as Corus Hotel, to invest in agro-tourism facilities to attract tourists to have fresh durians within the comfort of an urban dining space, while encouraging Malaysians to support domestic tourism, in time for Visit Malaysia 2020.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4702&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;4703&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_column_text]The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Malayan United Industries Berhad (MUI), Andrew Khoo said: \u201cThe durian is very much loved by Malaysians and tourists, particularly those from China. While its pungent aroma and creamy custard flesh have proven divisive for the palates of some of our discerning consumers, the fact remains that the durian has long cemented its reputation as the king of fruits in this country. In fact, Malaysia\u2019s durian is touted as the best in the world hence we should market it that way.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cSo, not only will you not find the \u201cno durian allowed\u201d signs at the Hotel, I am excited to share that we have invested approximately RM100,000.00 to create a first-ever \u201cone-of- a-kind\u201d urban dining place, aptly called \u201cThe Durian Room\u201d, within the premises of the Hotel.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The Durian Room draws inspiration from the more common cigar and wine-tasting rooms and will serve popular varietals such as Musang King and D24. This dedicated durian room is part of the hotel\u2019s transformation plan to introduce more lifestyle elements into its services. Durian365@Corus also features a distinctive Durian Dessert Platter which consists of eight specially-created desserts such as the Durian Crepe, Durian Tiramisu, San Sebastian Durian Cheesecake and durian soft-serve ice cream, in its Dondang Sayang Coffee House.<\/p>\n<p>Available daily from 12noon to 9pm, the platter is priced at RM78 nett for two, ideal for afternoon or evening tete-a-tete.
